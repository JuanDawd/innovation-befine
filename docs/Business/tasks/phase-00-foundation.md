# Phase 0 — Foundation

> Goal: working repo, DB connected, offline policy decided, empty role-aware shell deployed to staging. Nothing user-visible beyond a login screen.

## T001 — Initialize Next.js monorepo with Turborepo

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** none

### What to do
Scaffold a Turborepo monorepo with one Next.js application (`apps/web`) using the App Router. Add a `packages/` directory for shared TypeScript types and utilities.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `turbo build` runs without errors
- [ ] `apps/web` starts in development mode
- [ ] `packages/types` exists and is importable from `apps/web`
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled in all packages

---

## T002 — Configure code quality tooling

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T001

### What to do
Add ESLint (Next.js config), Prettier, and a shared config package. Add a pre-commit hook (Husky + lint-staged) that runs lint and format checks. Also document the input validation policy: all API/server action inputs must be validated with Zod schemas before reaching business logic.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `turbo lint` passes on a clean repo
- [ ] `turbo format` formats all files
- [ ] Pre-commit hook blocks commits with lint errors
- [ ] `docs/standards.md` note added: Zod validation required on all server-side inputs

## T003 — Environment variable schema

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T001

### What to do
Create `.env.example` with all required environment variable keys (no values). Add runtime validation using `zod` or `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` so the app fails fast on missing variables.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `.env.example` lists all required vars with inline comments
- [ ] App throws a clear error on startup if a required var is missing
- [ ] `.env` and `.env*.local` are in `.gitignore`

---

## T004 — Vercel project setup

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T001

### What to do
Create a Vercel project connected to the git repository. Configure the build command (`turbo build --filter=web`), output directory, and staging environment (preview deployments on every PR).

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Push to `main` triggers a production deploy
- [ ] Pull requests get a unique preview URL
- [ ] Environment variables added in Vercel dashboard match `.env.example`

---

## T005 — Neon Postgres setup

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T004

### What to do
Create a Neon project (free tier). Add the database URL to Vercel environment variables. Create a `dev` branch in Neon for local development and a `staging` branch for preview deploys.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `apps/web` can connect to Neon in local dev
- [ ] Preview deploys connect to the Neon `staging` branch
- [ ] Production connects to the Neon `main` branch
- [ ] Connection uses Neon's serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`)

## T006 — Drizzle ORM setup and migration workflow

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T005

### What to do
Install and configure Drizzle ORM with the Neon serverless adapter. Set up `drizzle-kit` for migrations. Add a `db:migrate` script and a `db:studio` script for the Drizzle visual editor.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `npm run db:migrate` applies pending migrations to the target DB
- [ ] `npm run db:studio` opens Drizzle Studio connected to the local/dev DB
- [ ] Schema files live in `packages/db/src/schema/`
- [ ] An empty initial migration runs successfully against Neon

## T007 — Better Auth spike and integration

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T006

### What to do
Install Better Auth and configure it with the Postgres adapter pointing to the Neon DB. Verify that the RBAC plugin works with the role model needed (cashier/admin, secretary, stylist, clothier). Verify Better Auth's built-in rate limiting protects the login endpoint against brute force. Create the auth tables migration.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Better Auth creates its required tables via migration (users, sessions, accounts)
- [ ] RBAC plugin supports custom roles without workarounds
- [ ] A test login (admin user seeded) works end-to-end
- [ ] Session is accessible in Next.js Server Components and API routes
- [ ] Login endpoint is rate-limited (confirm Better Auth's default limits or configure explicitly)

---

## T008 — Base UI (Base Web) spike

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T001

### What to do
Install Base Web (`baseui`) and its peer dependency (`styletron-react`). Render one representative component (e.g. a Button and a Table) inside the Next.js App Router. Confirm there are no SSR hydration mismatches or build errors.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Base Web components render without errors in development
- [ ] No hydration mismatch warnings in the browser console
- [ ] Production build (`next build`) completes without Base Web-related errors
- [ ] Document any workarounds needed (e.g. `"use client"` boundaries) in a comment or small `docs/` note

---

## T009 — Pusher free tier spike

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T001, T004

### What to do
Create a Pusher account (free tier). Install `pusher` (server SDK) and `pusher-js` (client). Trigger a test event from a Next.js API route and receive it in a React component. Confirm it works on a Vercel preview deploy.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Server can publish an event via Pusher in a Route Handler
- [ ] Client receives the event in real time without page refresh
- [ ] Works on a Vercel preview deploy (not just local) — requires T004 to be complete
- [ ] Pusher keys stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)

---

## T010 — RBAC role definitions

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T007

### What to do
Define the role enum and subtype enum in the shared `packages/types` package and in the Better Auth configuration. Roles: `admin`, `secretary`, `stylist`, `clothier`. Stylist subtypes: `manicurist`, `spa_manager`, `hairdresser`, `masseuse`, `makeup_artist`.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Role and stylist-subtype enums exported from `packages/types`
- [ ] Better Auth RBAC configured to use these roles
- [ ] Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to login
- [ ] Each role gets a placeholder home screen (empty, just a heading) after login

---

## T011 — Seed script for development

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** T010

### What to do
Create a `db:seed` script that inserts one user per role into the dev DB so developers can log in as any role without manual setup.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `npm run db:seed` runs without errors and is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- [ ] One admin, one secretary, one clothier, and one stylist (each subtype) are seeded
- [ ] Seed passwords documented in `.env.example` comments (dev-only)

---

## T077 — Offline policy document

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** pending
**Dependencies:** none

### What to do
Write `docs/research/offline-policy.md` defining which actions are offline-capable and which are online-only. This must be agreed before Phase 4A APIs are built so idempotency is designed in, not retrofitted.

Canonical decisions (confirm with business stakeholder):
- **Offline-capable:** ticket creation (`logged` status), piece mark-done.
- **Online-only:** checkout/payment, payout recording, catalog edits, business day open/close.

Include: what happens to queued actions if the business day closes while the device is offline.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document at `docs/research/offline-policy.md`
- [ ] Every user-initiated action in the app is listed with its offline classification
- [ ] Business stakeholder has signed off (record the date and name in the document)
- [ ] Document reviewed before Phase 4A task planning begins
